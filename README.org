#+title: Machine Learning execises

My exercise projects for machine learning, also for using orgmode as literate programming examples.

* tips for using org-babel
- ~C-c C-c~ to execute a code block
- ~C-c '~ to open the code block in a dedicated major mode buffer
  - ~C-c '~ to exit
- org-babel commands are housed in ~C-c C-v~
  - ~C-z~ to open associated process
